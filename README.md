## Available Scripts

To get started running this React app, run the following scripts in the directory:

`yarn`

Downloads and installs the dependencies.

`yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If you want to build the app for production

`yarn run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The files can be found in the /build directory.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## To be improved

List of things I'd like to improve if I had more time:

- Better styling (I did very little).
- Better typing. I skipped typing in a few places.
- Better loading, loaded, error states management.
- Better caching of the posts data instead of re-downloading data at every click. Wrap my components by a loading indicator HOC.
- Optimistic UI for the comments.
- Eject from create-react-app and change a few things in the configuration files.
